# 🏠 Prodigy ML Task 1: House Price Prediction 📈



**🎯 Task:** Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

**💾 Dataset:** [Kaggle House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

**📖 Project Overview**

This repository contains a simple machine learning model to predict house prices based on key features:

* **Square Footage:** The area of the house in square feet. 📏
* **Number of Bedrooms:** The count of bedrooms in the house. 🛌
* **Number of Bathrooms:** The count of bathrooms in the house. 🛀

The model is implemented using Python and the scikit-learn library, a popular tool for machine learning in Python. The dataset used for this project is synthetic and consists of the aforementioned columns along with the **House Price** (target variable in dollars).

The dataset is programmatically generated and saved as `your_dataset.csv` for demonstration purposes.

**⚙️ Requirements**

Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository: 💻

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/AJ22122003/PRODIGY_ML_TASK1.git](https://github.com/AJ22122003/PRODIGY_ML_TASK1.git)
cd PRODIGY_ML_TASK1
Explore the Jupyter Notebook: 📒 Open the Task_1.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to understand the code, data exploration, model training, and evaluation process.

Bash

jupyter notebook Task_1.ipynb
# or
jupyter lab Task_1.ipynb
Run the Notebook Cells: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to:

Generate the synthetic dataset (your_dataset.csv).
Load and preprocess the data.
Train a linear regression model.
Evaluate the model's performance.
Visualize the results. 📊
Examine the Dataset: The Prodigy-ML-Task_1_your_dataset.csv file contains the synthetic data used for training and testing the model.

View the Output: The ML_TASK_1_DATASET-AJINKYA.K.png file likely shows a visualization of the dataset or the model's predictions.

🧠 Model

This project implements a linear regression model to establish a linear relationship between the house features (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms) and the target variable (house price).

📊 Evaluation

The Jupyter Notebook (Task_1.ipynb) contains the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the trained linear regression model.
